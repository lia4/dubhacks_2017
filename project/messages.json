      "text": "<p>\tI teach calculus armed with a roll of toilet paper and an overactive imagination.\n\tBut before I get into that delightful tale, I have to go on a slight tangent. First, it\u2019s important to note that people generally don\u2019t push themselves to the point of burning out \u2013 that\u2019s essentially axiomatic. Second, if teaching calculus hasn\u2019t made it obvious, I like math. Therefore, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, but I\u2019m still slightly crestfallen whenever people tell me that they aren\u2019t taking AP Calculus because they think they will struggle.\n\tImagine my delight, though, when someone came to me, torn between math classes because calculus seemed difficult, but statistics seemed boring! Finally, I had a chance to show someone what I thought about calculus. So I tried to give a simple explanation that would convince this sophomore going-to-be junior that calculus wasn\u2019t going to be an insurmountable challenge.\n\t\u201cWell\u2026 The basic idea of an integral is that if you have enough infinitesimal values, they sum to a normal number. Intuitive enough, right?\u201d\n\tGenerally speaking, a blank stare is not the reaction I hope to see in the people I tutor. I racked my brains for a minute, and, like any other logical person under duress, I concluded that the solution was in the bathroom.\n\tRushing into the bathroom, I noticed a mop bucket in the corner, along with a cart of cleaning supplies \u2013 the janitor had been there recently. Perfect. And so, with all the urgency of a conventional bathroom-rusher, I ran straight into a stall and grabbed the fresh roll of toilet paper. Then I left.\n\tArmed with my Excalibur of mathematical education that I had pulled out of the dispenser, I was ready to slay the monster known to me simply as \u201cfear of calculus.\u201d\n\tI rolled out the first square, the first step to overcoming calculus consternation.\n\t\u201cSo, let\u2019s assume that this sheet has no thickness. So, we can agree it has no volume.\u201d\n\tI stacked on another sheet.\n\t\u201cDoes it have a volume now? Right, no, it really doesn\u2019t seem like it does.\u201d\n\tI looked up from my two sheets of toilet paper to a quizzical, I-question-your-sanity look. But don\u2019t worry! I\u2019ve gotten used to the initial embarrassment, and I\u2019m quite pleased to report that I generally get to watch it transform into a look that states \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant.\u201d\n\t\u201cWell, take a look at the rest of this roll. I can\u2019t count the number of sheets still on it, how about you? But it\u2019s clearly got a volume. Do you see where I\u2019m going with this?\u201d\n\tThe pieces were all clicking together now, and I could almost see them fitting together in my pupil\u2019s mind.\n\t\u201cOh, and by the way, this is the hardest thing you will do in first year calculus.\u201d\n\tThat day, I taught someone the theory behind integration, and convinced them to take AP Calculus. Today, she\u2019s having very little trouble and even enjoys the class, as I\u2019m reminded whenever I ask her how she\u2019s doing with it. As it turns out, a good analogy can simplify calculus a great deal, and toilet paper makes for a surprisingly good example. I could have kept teaching about rotations of solids, infinitesimal values, or, if I had two-ply, also discussed limits. All it would have taken is a few more assumptions and a couple demonstrations, and it would have been fantastic.\n\tI challenge the idea that there are things in the world too arcane to ever understand. I challenge the phrase \u201cIt\u2019s rocket science to me\u201d in myself and in anyone I meet, because I don\u2019t think the concept ever applies. I hope to continue passing creativity, passion, and accessibility from person to person. I challenge myself to think, to learn, to know, and to facilitate that experience for others, because I believe that everything can be comprehended with just a little bit of toilet paper. \n</p>",

Reflect on an idea or experience that has been important to your intellectual development.\n\n\tIt\u2019s quite a shame, but I\u2019m not a genius. When I was in elementary school, I wasn\u2019t innovative enough to discover the way to sum a large series of numbers like Gauss was. I wasn\u2019t curious enough to ask about why kettles rattled when they were put on the stove like Watt was. I wasn\u2019t even a shy, reserved kid with a mind filled to the brim with ideas like Einstein was. I was, however, told stories about these giants of our time: giants on whose shoulders much of modern society now stand.\n\tAs a young boy, instead of being told fairy tales, my dad would tell me stories of people my age that had amazing ideas. You could say that these people were my Disney heroes; they were the paragon of everything I wanted to be and become. Of course, it\u2019s highly ambitious at best for a 4 year old to say \u201cI want to be like Einstein!\u201d Was I wrong to think that I could equal these prodigies? It\u2019s very possible. But I still have time to make my own contribution. After all, the most important discoveries they made were during their adult lives, and there\u2019s still a lot of time in the future \u2013 time for innovations, questions, and ideas, any one of which could be my own. Maybe it\u2019ll be Li\u2019s Theorem, or perhaps element 119 will be named Liium\u2026 Well, I\u2019ve got until then to think of a better name.\n\"</p>",
